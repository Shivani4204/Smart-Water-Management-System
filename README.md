🚀 Installation
Prerequisites

Arduino IDE (1.8.x or later) or PlatformIO
ESP32 board support installed
USB to Serial driver for ESP32

Setup Steps

Clone the repository

bash   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp32-water-management.git
   cd esp32-water-management

Install ESP32 Board Support

Example Session
========== SYSTEM STATUS ==========
Mode: AUTOMATIC
Water Level: 35.2 cm
Flow Rate: 2.3 L/min
Total Volume: 12.5 L
Pressure: 14.7 PSI
Current: 1.2 A
Vibration: Normal
Pump Status: RUNNING
===================================
Automatic Mode Logic

Pump starts when water level < 10 cm
Pump stops when water level > 50 cm
Emergency stop on vibration detection or overcurrent

🛡️ Safety Features

Overcurrent Protection: Automatically stops pump if current exceeds 5A
Vibration Detection: Shuts down on abnormal mechanical vibrations
Sensor Validation: Filters invalid ultrasonic readings
Timeout Protection: Prevents sensor lockups with timeout mechanisms
Manual Override: Emergency manual control available anytime

📊 Customization
Adjust these constants in the code for your specific setup:
cppconst int MIN_WATER_LEVEL = 10;   // Start pump threshold (cm)
const int MAX_WATER_LEVEL = 50;   // Stop pump threshold (cm)
const int PUMP_SPEED = 255;       // PWM speed (0-255)
🔍 Troubleshooting
Pump won't start

Check L298N connections and power supply
Verify motor wires are properly connected
Ensure IN1/IN2 signals are reaching driver

Ultrasonic sensor shows -1

Check TRIG and ECHO pin connections
Ensure sensor has clear line of sight
Verify 5V power to sensor

Flow sensor not registering

Confirm water is actually flowing
Check interrupt pin connection
Verify sensor orientation (arrow shows flow direction)
